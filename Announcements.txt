<br>It's tournament week so we will not be running normal league this week. Wednesday will be casual play and possibly a king of the Table event and Saturday will be casual play, possibly another King of the Table and possibly the billiards exam. Registration for the tournament will close Friday evening! If you are registered, be sure to keep an eye on your email for any more information about the tournament.
<br>See you at the tables!
